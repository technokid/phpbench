CHANGELOG
=========

develop
-------

Backward compatibility breaks:

- DBAL extension removed.
- PHPBench Reports extension removed.
- Removed XDebug Trace integration
- Removed `--query` featre (only worked with DBAL, too complex).
- Removed `--context` (depreacted in favor of `--tag`).
- Removed `archive` and `delete` commands.
- Assertions now accept a single expression rather than a set of
  configuration options.
- Type hints have been added in most places - possibly causing issues with
  any extensions.
- Assets (storage, xdebug profiles) are now placed in `.phpbench`
- Services referenced via. fully qualified class names instead of strings.

Features

- Configuration profiles
- XDebug extension is loaded by default if extension is loaded
- Baseline: Specify baseline suite when running benchmarks and show differences in
  reports #648
- Assert against the baseline
- Show PHP version and the status of XDebug and Opcache in the runner output
  #649
- Add `@Timeout` to enable a timeout to be specified for any given benchmark -
  @dantleech #614

Improvements

 - All assets now placed in `.phpbench` directory in CWD (instead of
   `./_storage` and `./xdebug`
 - `--tag` implicitly stores the benchmark (no need to additionally use
   `--store`)
 - Decrease benchmark overhead by rendering parameters in-template -
   @marc-mabe
